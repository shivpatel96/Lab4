  		<div class = info>How does IS differ from Computer Science?</div>
  		
  		<p>
  		Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CMSC) both involve computer technology. Unlike IS, CMSC frequently takes an inner-workings perspective of technology and involves the principles of hardware and software design.
  		</br>
 
  		</br>
  		Information Systems, on the other hand, focuses on the entire system of information, knowledge, delivery and use, taking an external, human-based perspective on technology - its focus is on how technology can be implemented to serve the informational needs of people and organizations. This is why at UMBC we refer to Information Systems as the human side of computing. IS graduates from UMBC have opportunities to really make a difference—have an impact—on technologies that affect everyone from children to retirees.
  		</br>
  		
  		</br>
  		IS graduates enter various industries with more than just the technical skills of programming, network applications and design, operating systems, telecommunications, database application and design, and web development and design. They also leave UMBC with a strong business and management background. In fact, many graduates have gone on to start their own successful thriving businesses. UMBC Information Systems students also develop excellent human communication skills that can be used to interact with a variety of audiences with various backgrounds. These skills are not only key career talents but excellent life skills.
  		</p>
  		
  		<div class = info>What Kind of Jobs Can I Obtain with an Information Systems Degree?</div>
  		
  		<p>Information Systems graduates are problem-solvers with excellent communication skills and can be employed in a wide rand of jobs such as:</p>
  		<ul class="b">
  			<li>Data Scientists</li>
  			<li>Network engineers</li>
  			<li>Cybersecurity professionals</li>
  			<li>Chief Information Officers</li>
  			<li>Software engineers</li>
  			<li>Network administrators</li>
  			<li>Systems analysts</li>
  			<li>Systems integrators</li>
  			<li>Systems designers</li>
  			<li>Database managers</li>
  			<li>Database administrators</li>
  			<li>Interface specialists</li>
  			<li>Product support professionals</li>
  			<li>Programmers</li>
  			<li>Managers of information systems</li>
  			<li>Academic researchers</li>
  			<li>and more</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Careers in IT (Information Technology) and IS (Information Systems) offer some of the highest post-undergraduate starting salaries. In addition to higher starting salaries, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that computer and information technology occupations will grow 13% over the next decade, which is well above the average for all occupations.
		</br>
		</br>
		Overall, graduates of UMBC’s Information Systems programs are enjoying relatively short periods on the IT job market after graduation, many with multiple job options from which to choose, and at salaries that are not only comparable with the national average, but might be considered quite attractive to an adult in their early 20s.
  		</p>
  		
  		<div class = info>What Do Information Systems Majors Study?</div>
  		<p>Information Systems offers two baccalaureate degrees: a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Information Systems, and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Business Technology Administration.
		</br>
		</br>
		The B.S. is the more technical of the two degrees and prepares students for positions involving the analysis and design of systems, databases, and computer networks. The B.S. consists of 64 credit hours of coursework in IS, computer programming, mathematics and statistics, management, economics, accounting, and technical writing.
		</br>
		</br>
		The B.A. focuses on microcomputer-based office automation systems.  It also requires the student to complete a minor or certificate. The B.A. consists of 55 credit hours (not including those from the selected minor or certificate) in IS, mathematics, statistics and management.The Information Systems Department also offers a combined B.S./M.S. degree intended for academically superior juniors who wish to apply to the M.S. program after graduation. If admitted to the B.S./M.S. program, they will take, in their Senior year, three graduate-level courses which will be applied to the M.S.
		</br>
		</br>
		We also offer an array of graduate degrees in IS, Health IT, and Human Centered Computing. This includes our industry leading Online M.S. in Information Systems program.
  		</p>
  		<div class = info>Special Opportunities for Information Systems Students</div>
  		<p>UMBC has the largest cooperative education program in Maryland. Information Systems students participate in this program in greater numbers than any other major on campus. The department encourages all students to participate in co-op or internship programs. Students have found the experience invaluable in helping them understand class concepts and in getting a job after graduation.  All co-op and many internship programs are paid positions.  Many may also be used toward college credits.
